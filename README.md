# Angular Form Builder

Dynamic forms are a powerful tool in Angular for situations where you
need to create forms with a similar structure but varying content, like
questionnaires or quizzes. This approach allows you to define the form's
shape using a JSON object, making it faster and easier to generate new
versions. With dynamic forms, you can modify the questions on the fly
without changing the application code itself. To learn more about
